The conception of money is different for the old and the young. The old generation believes that money should be saved in case of the urgent situation, while most young people think that money should be spent to realize its value. When I was struggled about the different opinions, I saw the news report about a man got back his money that he saved in the early 1990s, which was about 1000 RMB. People made their comment that this amount of money meant so much at that time, which could buy a nice big house, while today it was just a big meal in the restaurant. This news inspired me to make reasonable plan of money. The old way to treat money is not suitable, because money will lose its value as time goes by. I choose to spend part of money while saving another part of it.The conception of money is different for the old and the young.
